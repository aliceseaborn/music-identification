Greetings,

This code leans heavily on file hierarchies, particularly for the WAV files under (1) and the fingerprints under (2).

	(1). ~\Project 3 - Submission\Project 3 - Code\Music\WAV
	(2). ~\Project 3 - Code\Development\Fingerprints

I have left everything setup so that new prints don't need to be manufactured and new plots don't need to be generated but you could easily delete the plots and the fingerprints and execute 'Doc_GetAllFingerPrints.m' after setting up the correct path to (1). Then you could experiment with the settings in 'Doc_RunAnalysis.m' and try changing the tolerance and noise ranges to validate the algorithms robustness, this would require confirming the path to (2) so that the fingerprints can be accessed by the analysis.

Happy hunting.


Respectfully,
Austin, Ramya & Tyler.
